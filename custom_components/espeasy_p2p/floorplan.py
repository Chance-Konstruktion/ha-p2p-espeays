"""Put the P2P mesh on Floorplan-Hub's floor plan, if it is installed.

What this integration actually knows about topology is one thing: which
units have been heard from, and how long ago. It does not measure link
quality between two ESP nodes -- they broadcast, and we listen. So the
picture drawn here is the honest one: Home Assistant in the middle, one
edge out to each unit, coloured by how fresh that unit's last packet is.

That makes a node about to fall off the mesh visible before it does,
which is the thing a floor plan is actually good for.

Nothing here is required for the integration to work. With no hub
installed, `floorplan_provider` writes a dict nobody reads.
