"""Just enough Home Assistant for the floor-plan adapter to import.

The conformance kit needs nothing but pytest. The adapter it checks does
import Home Assistant, though -- for the device registry and the
dispatcher -- so those two get stubs here rather than a 300 MB dependency
in CI for two lookups.

Everything stubbed below is stubbed because the adapter *uses* it. If a
future change reaches for more of Home Assistant, the import will fail
loudly here, which is the right moment to notice.
