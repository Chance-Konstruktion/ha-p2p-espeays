# 📡 ESPEasy & RPiEasy P2P for Home Assistant

**Push-based, local-first bridge between ESPEasy & RPiEasy nodes and Home Assistant — no MQTT, no cloud, no polling.**

Drop your ESP8266/ESP32 or Raspberry Pi sensors on the LAN, set them to **C013 (ESPEasy/RPiEasy P2P)** controller, and they show up in Home Assistant on their own. Every value is pushed the moment it changes. Every relay can be switched back from Lovelace.

## 🤔 Why this exists

> **MQTT is great. Until you don't want to run a broker. Until you don't want to flash credentials. Until you just want a sensor on the wall to show up in Home Assistant — and stay there.**

ESPEasy and RPiEasy already speak **C013** — a tiny UDP broadcast protocol made for ESPEasy/RPiEasy nodes to gossip with each other. This integration teaches Home Assistant to listen on the same wire. That's it. That's the whole trick.

### 🪶 Zero broker
No MQTT, no Mosquitto, no auth headers. Plain UDP on your LAN.

</td>
<td align="center" width="33%">

### ⚡ Push, not poll
Values arrive at HA the moment ESPEasy reads them. Sub-second freshness, no API hammering.

```

<details>
<summary><b>What's actually in the packet?</b></summary>

A C013 frame is a small fixed-layout struct with:

- **Header** — protocol version + packet type (`SENSOR_DATA_PACKET` or similar)
- **Source unit** — the ESPEasy unit ID (1–255)
- **Task index** — which task on the node fired this
- **Plugin ID** — DHT, BMP280, switch, analog, …
- **Values 1–4** — up to four `float32` slots per task

`espeasy_p2p` binds each `(unit, task, value-index)` triple to one Home Assistant entity and feeds new floats straight into its state.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1 · Install via HACS

This integration is part of the **default HACS store** — no custom repository needed.

```text
HACS → Integrations → search "ESPEasy P2P" → Download
```

[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Chance-Konstruktion&repository=ha-espeasy-p2p&category=integration)

Download, then restart Home Assistant.

### 2 · Add the integration

```text
Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration → "ESPEasy P2P"
```

Pick the UDP port (default `8266`) and an optional unit number for HA itself. Confirm.

### 3 · Point your nodes at HA

On every ESPEasy or RPiEasy unit, in **Controllers → Add → ESPEasy P2P (C013)**:

```yaml
Controller IP:   <your Home Assistant IP>
Controller Port: 8266
Unit Number:     <unique 1–255 per node>
Enabled:         ✓
```

Save. Within seconds the device shows up under **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPEasy P2P**.

> 💡 **Non-tech check** — if the ESPEasy *Tools → Log* shows `C013: send to <HA-IP>` and you don't see the device in HA, jump to [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting). 9 out of 10 times it's a firewall on the HA host.

## 🎚️ Switching relays

Two-way control is supported for tasks that map to writable GPIOs.

<details>
<summary><b>Supported output kinds</b></summary>

| ESPEasy plugin | HA platform | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GPIO Switch (P001) | `switch` | On/off, retained |
| Relay / Bistable | `switch` | Mirrored locally on the node |
| PWM Output (P019) | `light` (brightness) | 0–1023 mapped to 0–255 |
| GPIO Pulse | `button` | Fires a one-shot C013 frame |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How HA → node packets are addressed</b></summary>

When you flip a switch in Lovelace, `espeasy_p2p` sends a **unicast** C013 frame to the node's last-seen IP with the target task index and the new value. The node executes the command locally — no acknowledgement is required because the next sensor broadcast confirms the new state.

If the node is offline, the packet is silently dropped. HA marks the entity `unavailable` after the per-node `last_seen` timeout (default **5 min**).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Known limitations</b></summary>

- **No encryption.** C013 is plain UDP — keep it on a trusted VLAN.
- **No retries.** One packet per click. Use HA automations + `last_seen` if you need delivery guarantees.
- **Unit numbers must be unique** across your LAN. Duplicate IDs = entity collisions.

</details>

## 🗺️ Floorplan-Hub

If [Floorplan-Hub](https://github.com/Chance-Konstruktion/ha-floorplan-hub) is
installed, the mesh appears on the floor plan by itself — no card, no YAML,
nothing to configure. If it is not installed, nothing here does anything at
all: the adapter writes a dict into `hass.data` that nobody reads.

What it draws is only what this integration actually knows. It cannot measure
the path between two ESP nodes — they broadcast and we listen — so inventing
node-to-node links would be a lie. Instead: Home Assistant in the middle, one
edge out to each unit, coloured by how long ago that unit was last heard from.

| | |
|---|---|
| green | heard from within the last 40s |
| amber | quiet, but not yet timed out — **about to drop off** |
| red | offline |

The amber band is the useful part: a node on its way out is visible before it
is gone. Edges are dashed, because nothing measured them.

Each node sits in the area you already gave its device — the adapter reads the
device registry rather than asking you to place it a second time. Every node
offers a **Neu abfragen** action that triggers the same targeted resync the
integration uses after a command.

The adapter is one file, `floorplan.py`, plus a vendored copy of the hub's
provider shim. There is no dependency on the hub in `manifest.json`, and load
order does not matter.

| `espeasy_p2p.reload_unit` | `unit` | Drop cached entities + rediscover |
| `espeasy_p2p.rename_unit` | `unit`, `new_name` | Persist a friendly name |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration options</b></summary>

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UDP port | `8266` | Must match the controller settings on every node |
| HA unit number | `250` | Unit ID Home Assistant uses in its own announce packets |
| HA peer name | `Home Assistant` | Name HA advertises to the C013 mesh |
| Decimal precision | `3` | Decimal places shown for sensor values (0–6) |

Per-switch GPIO pins and command templates are configured later via the
integration's **Configure** (options) dialog. The stale/offline timeout
(120 s) is fixed.

> **Networking:** the integration receives UDP **broadcasts** on port 8266.
> This only works when Home Assistant can see them on the LAN — i.e. HA OS,
> Supervised, or a container started with **host networking**
> (`--network=host`). In a bridged Docker network broadcasts never arrive and
> no nodes will be discovered.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>❌ No devices show up after I set the controller</b></summary>

1. On the node: **Tools → Log** — do you see `C013: send to <HA-IP>:8266`?
2. On HA host: `sudo ufw status` / firewall — UDP **8266** inbound must be open.
3. Same subnet? C013 broadcasts don't cross routers without a relay.
4. HA log: `Settings → System → Logs` — filter for `espeasy_p2p`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ Entities exist but values stay at "unknown"</b></summary>

- Plugin ID may be unknown to the integration. Open an issue with the **Devices → device info** screenshot and a log line containing the packet.
- Task values 2–4 are only populated by multi-value plugins (e.g. DHT22 = temp + hum). Single-value plugins leave them empty.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔌 Switching a relay does nothing</b></summary>

- The node's controller must have **Send to controller** enabled and at least one **Controller** entry pointing at HA.
- Confirm the task is bound to a writable GPIO (not a read-only sensor).
- Watch the node log while flipping the switch — you should see a `C013: recv` line.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⏱️ A switch flips back / state lags on short intervals</b></summary>

Switch state in HA is confirmed three ways: a C013 **push** from the node
when the value changes, a **30 s `/json` poll** as a safety net, and — right
after HA itself toggles a switch on — a short **targeted re-read burst**
(~3 s / 8 s / 20 s, that one node only). So a relay that auto-switches off a
few seconds later (internal timer/pulse) is caught quickly, with no
steady-state overhead.

The remaining limit: **on/off cycles faster than ~3 s** that HA can't observe
in between may be missed (HA might only ever see one of the two states). For
accurate state on very fast-cycling outputs, make the node **broadcast on
every change** (`Send to controller` so each transition is pushed) rather
than relying on HA to catch it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌀 Duplicate entities after a unit-number change</b></summary>

Use `espeasy_p2p.reload_unit` or remove the device under **Settings → Devices & Services** and let it rediscover.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🗑️ Delete or replace a single node</b></summary>

Every discovered ESPEasy node is its **own device**, not part of one big
integration device. To remove a mis-detected, retired, or replaced node,
open it under **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPEasy P2P**, click the
node device, and choose **Delete** from the three-dot menu — no need to
remove and re-add the whole integration. The `espeasy_p2p.remove_node`
service does the same thing by unit number. A node only comes back if it
sends a fresh heartbeat afterwards, so deleting a retired unit makes it
stay gone.
